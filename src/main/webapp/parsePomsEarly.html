  <p>
  If checked, POMs are parsed early in the build process to make the information on the project available to 
  all pre steps (e.g. <code>POM_VERSION</code>).
  </p>
  <p>
  All <a href="https://maven.apache.org/maven-ci-friendly.html">CI Friendly Version Parameters</a>
  are filtered out, so it will reflect the original coordinates (or ones computed by some Maven core extension).
  The information is then updated for the main build step again,
  so if you set some specific version that will be applied.
